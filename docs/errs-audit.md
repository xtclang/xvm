# Failures with nowhere to go

An audit, not a refactor. The output is findings to triage, not a diff: each site needs a
judgement about whether the failure is real and where it ought to go, and those judgements belong
to whoever owns the code.

Measured on `lagergren/errs`, which is `origin/master` at `fbdeb86c7` plus the errs work.

## What was counted

| | |
|---|---|
| `System.err.print*` / `printStackTrace()` in `javatools/src/main/java` | **56** |
| `catch (… ignore) { }` with an empty body | **35** |

### Printed rather than reported, by area

| area | sites |
|---|---|
| `runtime` | 16 |
| `asm` | 8 |
| `asm/constants` | 8 |
| `javajit` | 6 |
| `runtime/template/_native/web` | 5 |
| `compiler/ast` | 3 |
| `javajit/builders` | 3 |
| `runtime/template/_native/crypto` | 2 |
| `tool` | 2 |
| `asm/ast`, `runtime/template/_native/fs`, `runtime/template` | 1 each |

### What the empty catches swallow

| exception | sites |
|---|---|
| `IOException` | 14 |
| `RuntimeException` | 6 |
| `CompilerException` | 4 |
| `WrapperException`, `ArithmeticException`, `NameNotFoundException`, `KeyStoreException`, `IllegalStateException` | 1 each |

34 of the 35 name the variable `ignore`, one `ignored`. The naming is at least honest: these are
deliberate, and the question for each is whether the deliberate choice is still right.

## The sites worth looking at first

Of the 56 printed failures, **five** occur where a listener appears to be in scope - that is, the
code could have reported and chose to print. Those are the clearest candidates:

| site | what it prints |
|---|---|
| `compiler/ast/Expression.java:811` | `"No conversion found for " + constVal` |
| `compiler/ast/ConvertExpression.java:93` | `"No conversion found for " + aVal[i]` |
| `compiler/ast/NameExpression.java:1181` | `"TODO: AST for " + this` |
| `asm/ConstantPool.java:3944` | each error of a local `ErrorList`, then throws |
| `asm/constants/TypeConstant.java:4723` | commented out; not a live site |

**Deliberately not changed here.** The first two carry `// TODO GG: remove the soft assert below`,
so they are someone's marker rather than an oversight, and "fixing" them would silently change what
a compile prints. They are listed so the decision can be made by whoever wrote them.

`ConstantPool:3944` is different in kind: it is the static implicits bootstrap, where no
caller-supplied listener exists, so printing is close to the only option available. It is evidence
for the ownership discussion in `errs.md` rather than a defect on its own.

## Why this is worth doing eventually

The prior-art branch ran the same audit and found real bugs in this category, not just untidy code:

- a DNS continuation caught `Throwable`, so an `Error` reached XTC code as "host not found", and an
  interrupt was discarded without restoring the flag;
- `KeyStoreOperations.deleteKeyStoreEntry` swallowed a failed delete, so a certificate revocation
  reported success with the revoked certificate still in the store;
- `Launcher.showSystemVersion` relied on catching an NPE to mean "not in the repository".

The shape to look for is the same each time: a `catch` whose body is empty because there was
nowhere to report, in code where the caller had every right to be told.

## How to work through it

1. Triage the 35 empty catches by what is swallowed. The 14 `IOException` sites are the richest
   seam - an I/O failure that nobody hears about usually means a later failure with a confusing
   cause.
2. For each, decide: genuinely nothing to report, report to a listener already in scope, or
   propagate. Only the middle case is a code change of the kind this branch has been making.
3. Do the `runtime` prints last. They are the largest group and the least reachable by a listener
   today, because the runtime side of ownership has not been done - see `errs.md`.

Expect the output to be issues rather than commits. A site that turns out to be a real bug deserves
its own fix with its own test, not a sweep.
