/**
 * An implementation of the `Session` interface.
 *
 * The Session implementation is a service because concurrent requests related to the same session
 * can be processing concurrently, and the session represents mutable state managed by the
 * application on behalf of (for the benefit of) the user. Despite the concurrent nature described
 * here, the SessionImpl service itself is not explicitly concurrent, because the use of the session
 * by various concurrent requests would almost certainly be more error prone if access to the
 * session were not serialized (i.e. performed in some order). The alternative is chaos.
 *
 * The implementation also does not conduct any I/O. From a persistence perspective, for example,
 * the session is a mostly-passive participant. The reasoning is simple: I/O operations have
 * unpredictable latencies, and each session is a natural bottleneck in a concurrent system.
