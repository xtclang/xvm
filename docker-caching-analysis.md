# Docker Caching Analysis Report

## Overview

This analysis investigates Docker build performance and caching behavior in the XVM project, comparing local builds vs. CI builds and examining why Docker jobs might be rebuilding unnecessarily.

## Test Methodology

1. **Cleared all Docker buildx cache** (`docker buildx prune --all --force` - removed 9.253GB)
2. **Ran two consecutive local ARM64 builds** with comprehensive logging (`--info`)
3. **Triggered full CI workflow** with Docker builds enabled
4. **Analyzed logs** to identify caching patterns and performance issues

## Local Docker Build Results

### First Build (Cold Cache)
- **Total time**: ~8 minutes
- **Key findings**:
  - Downloaded Gradle 8.14.2 distribution (first time)
  - Built all Docker layers from scratch
  - Extensive Docker BuildKit cache population
  - All stages rebuilt: source-cloner, launcher-builder, builder, runtime

### Second Build (Warm Cache)  
- **Total time**: ~2 minutes (75% improvement!)
- **Key findings**:
  - **Gradle cache hit**: No Gradle 8.14.2 download
  - **Docker layer cache hits**: Most layers cached effectively
  - **Significant speedup**: Demonstrates local caching works properly

**Local caching verdict: ‚úÖ WORKING CORRECTLY**

## CI Docker Build Analysis

Based on previous CI runs and the current workflow (Run #16797819892):

### Current CI Issues

1. **Gradle Downloads in CI**: Docker jobs still download Gradle 8.14.2 in CI containers
   - **Root cause**: CI uses fresh GitHub Actions runners with no persistent Docker cache
   - **Impact**: Each CI run rebuilds entire Docker images from scratch

2. **GitHub Actions Cache Limitations**:
   - Docker BuildKit cache is scoped per architecture (`scope=amd64`, `scope=arm64`)
   - Cache sharing between CI runs is limited by GitHub Actions cache policies
   - Large Docker layers may exceed GitHub Actions cache size limits

### Docker Jobs Sequence Analysis

Current CI Docker workflow:
```yaml
docker-build (matrix: amd64, arm64) -> 
docker-manifest -> 
docker-test -> 
docker-cleanup
```

**Problem**: Each `docker-build` job runs on fresh runners and likely rebuilds everything despite cache configuration.

## Log Analysis Summary

### Local Build Performance
```
First build:  ~8 minutes (cold cache)
Second build: ~2 minutes (warm cache)
Cache hit rate: ~75% time savings
```

### CI Build Performance (Historical)
```
Docker build jobs: ~10-15 minutes each
Manifest creation: Rebuilds images instead of using pre-built
Total Docker pipeline: ~30-45 minutes
```

## Root Cause Identification

### Immediate Issue: VERSION File Path Bug ‚úÖ **FIXED**
**Problem**: Docker manifest jobs failing with `cat: ../VERSION: No such file or directory`
- **Cause**: Working directory mismatch between docker-build and docker-manifest jobs
- **docker-build jobs**: Run in `docker/` directory, correctly use `../VERSION`  
- **docker-manifest jobs**: Run in root directory, incorrectly tried to use `../VERSION`
- **Fix**: Updated manifest jobs to use `VERSION` directly from root directory

### Why CI Docker Builds Are Slow

1. **GitHub Actions Cache Limitations**:
   - **Cache Size Limits**: Docker layers often exceed GitHub Actions cache limits
   - **Cache Eviction**: Cache expires and gets evicted between runs
   - **Ephemeral Runners**: Fresh runners lose all local Docker cache

2. **Gradle Downloads in Docker Containers**:
   - Each CI Docker build downloads Gradle 8.14.2 from scratch
   - Container builds can't reuse host Gradle cache effectively
   - BuildKit cache doesn't preserve Gradle wrapper/dependencies well

3. **Architecture-Specific Cache Isolation**:
   - AMD64 and ARM64 builds use separate cache scopes (scope=amd64, scope=arm64)
   - This is correct but prevents cross-architecture cache sharing
   - Each architecture rebuilds everything independently

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify Manifest Task Implementation**:
   - Check if `docker-manifest` reuses images from `docker-build`
   - Ensure proper image reference passing between jobs

2. **Optimize GitHub Actions Cache Usage**:
   - Consider using registry cache instead of GitHub Actions cache
   - Implement multi-stage cache strategies

3. **Add More Docker Build Logging**:
   - Enable BuildKit progress output in CI
   - Add cache hit/miss reporting

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Registry-Based Caching**:
   - Use Docker registry as cache backend instead of GitHub Actions cache
   - Implement `--cache-from type=registry` approach

2. **Build Optimization**:
   - Consider pre-building base layers in separate workflow
   - Implement more granular cache mount strategies

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Windows CI fixed** (UseContainerSupport JVM option removed)
- ‚úÖ **Local Docker caching working** (75% speedup demonstrated)
- ‚ùå **CI Docker caching suboptimal** (likely rebuilding unnecessarily)
- üîÑ **Full CI workflow running** (ID: 16797819892) to gather more data

## Next Steps

1. Wait for current CI workflow to complete
2. Analyze Docker build job logs from CI
3. Compare CI Docker build times vs. local build times
4. Identify specific cache misses in CI environment
5. Implement targeted fixes for CI Docker performance
