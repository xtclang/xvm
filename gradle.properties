# Should be be extra verbose in the XTC Gradle plugin, e.g. by promoting some info log lines to lifecycle?

#
# Should we include the manualTests project as part of the aggregated XVM build?
#
# It is STRONGLY recommended to keep this "true", because otherwise you don't get IDE support. IntelliJ
# requires any project you want to work with to be declared in the build, or it will be invisible.
#
# If you experience build speed issues, set "includeBuildAttachManualTests" to false, which will make it
# show up in IntelliJ, get configured quickly, but not include any part of the build lifecycle from root,
# so that a "build" will not also trigger compilation of the manual tests source set. For GitHub
# workflows, we always run with manual tests both enabled as includedBuild, and attached to the
# XDK root build lifecycle.
#
# You can also locally override these properties with environment variables, just like any
# other Gradle property prefixed with "ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_", for example
# ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_includeBuildManualTests=false, if you want to persist a different
# behavior than the default in your build environment.

# Should lang (LSP server + IntelliJ plugin) be included and attached to the root build?

# includeBuildAttachLang: Whether lang lifecycle tasks are part of root build
#
# Use ./gradlew lang:build to build LSP server + IntelliJ plugin separately.
#

# TODO: LSP do not check in true/true here. Used for dev since we are still on an alpha version,
#  which benefits in lowered complexity, and direct access to XVM composite builds for bootstrapping.
#  There are no significant problems moving the lang support out into its repository, but we want
#  a working alpha for the users to play with first.
