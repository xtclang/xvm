# Gradle project properties.
#
# The XDK build has some convenience functionality - it will make sure that all ".properties" files
# for a particular project have their key/value pairs added to the environment of the project.
# The evaluation order is bottom-up, so that if a property is defined twice, the nearest defintion
# to the project is the one that will be implemented. This makes it possible to conveniently extend
# or replace any project properties that are inherited by subprojects.
#
# The last thing the XDK builder does is to check $GRADLE_USER_HOME for properties files, and parse
# them as will. To access the XDK artifact repository or any GitHub actions, a GitHub token is required.
# The token is a secret, so it should not be checked into the XDK repository build tree. This is not
# specific to GitHub, but all projects containing a repository name will be evaluated.
# the credentials in question, add them to your $GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties file like so:
#

org.gradle.parallel=true
org.gradle.caching=true
org.gradle.caching.debug=false
org.gradle.profile=true

# GitHub XTC organization repository properties.

# Note: # These properties should be defined in $GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties, as they contain secrets:
