# XTC plugin specific properties
#
# All properties files in a project hierarchy are ingested on build, and redefinitions of the same property
# deeper in the file tree overwrite those at shallower levels, to avoid per-module configuration granularity
#
# For example, some of the repository information on where we publish our artifact are defined here, but
# some in the ancestral root gradle.properties file, and some (secrets), typically in
# $GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties

# The default is to derive javatools.jar from the xdk or xdkDistribution configurations. However, it is useful to be able to
# invoke it from the same thread without JavaExec when debugging crossovers between the build system and the XDK
# implementation.

# Do we want to Gradle artifact to be built too? The contents are redundant compared to the parent Maven publication,
# but the metadata is not, which is required for XTC support in an XTC project outside the XDK build.
