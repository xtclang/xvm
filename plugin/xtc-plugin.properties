#
# XTC plugin specific properties
#
# All properties files in a project hierarchy are ingested on build, and redefinitions of the same property
# deeper in the file tree overwrite those at shallower levels, to avoid per-module configuration granularity
#
# For example, some of the repository information on where we publish our artifact are defined here, but
# some in the ancestral root gradle.properties file, and some (secrets), typically in
# $GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle.properties
