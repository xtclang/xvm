TODO: XTC Language; Can we change the $ template operator to work like Kotlin does and just nearly like Kotlin, but different?
TODO: Add a settings plugin that is also part of the distribution, which contains things like the github repository syntactic sugare, and maybe sugar for finding the local XDK installation and its repo.
TODO: Implement a release action (including weaving the correct binary native launchers and symlinks), and publish tagged to GitHub, afterwards bumping to the next patch release version as a SNAPSHOT version.
TODO: Make sure forceRebuild = true flag work for xtcCompile and its task environment.
TODO: Gradle.useLogger - add a custom logger with timing, start and finish, indentation and levels, with possibilities to add outputs like a file or stderr. Configure through gradle properties?
TODO: Maven plugin from flatfile/distro repo. Add our own plugindefinitionspdec ?
TODO: Create a github template for the "simplest" xtc project possible
TODO: Add runXtcNative and compileXtcNative, actually model a local distribution in a build logic.kt class.
TODO: Get rid of the project delegate stuff, just extend project?

./plugin/build.gradle.kts:    // TODO distribute and package Javadocs in the future, when we have them.
./xdk/build.gradle.kts:    // TODO these are added twice to the archive configuration. We probably don't want that.

./xdk/build.gradle.kts: * TODO better copying, even if it means hardcoding directory names.

./xdk/build.gradle.kts:// TODO: Add a sanity check, that makes sure all files in the distribution are there,
./xdk/build.gradle.kts:// TODO - Keep dir patterns here too, or have it return copy specs based on resources
./build-logic/common-plugins/src/main/kotlin/org.xvm.build.version.gradle.kts:// TODO if we can fold these functions into the XdkBuildLogic class, it would be a lot nicer.
./build-logic/common-plugins/src/main/kotlin/org.xvm.build.java.gradle.kts:// TODO add more linting, integrate lint fix/checkstyle/spotless.

./javatools_launcher/build.gradle.kts: * TODO: We could add a mechanism to native compile this, but it would have to cross compile
./javatools/build.gradle.kts:// TODO: Move these to buildSrc, the XDK composite build does use them in some different places.
./javatools/build.gradle.kts:    // TODO: It may be fewer special cases if we just add to the source sets from these dependencies, but it's not
./javatools/build.gradle.kts:    from(file(xdkImplicitsPath)) // TODO Hack: this should be changed to use a consumable configuration, and/or moving javautils as a subproject, as it is never used standalone, just as part of a fat javatools jar.
