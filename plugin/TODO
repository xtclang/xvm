Prio:

* Allow redirection of stdout/stderr to file for xtc tasks
* Native launcher compile and run tasks.
* Simplest app template, or what is required.
* Add git script helpers and lock down master from direct pushes by anyone.
* Accumulate in folder.

TODO: Add byte ingestion counters for the compiler, perhaps, so we can tell if a rerun actually took place just by looking at the screen.
TODO: Add a configuraton/text file/dsl, anything that can be read from disk that is interpreted as arguments for the launcher. This would be
useful and could be drawn out directly from xtc kotlin gradle dsls in the plugin with very low complexity. I have at a few occaasins
wished I had something like that
TODO: xtcRunTestAll should not break if we don't have test source sets, it should warn and exit.
TODO: Move javatool_unicode generation tables to some other part of the build logic. If we reach lib_ecstasy and we have e.g. build logic cache hits for unicode generation, we should interpret it to mean that we want to overwrite the resources for lib_ecstasy because there are new tables.
TODO runXtc/All should not fail for e.g. test when there is no test source set.
TODO: Fix the unicode depenency problems.
TODO: is pruneBuildRepo executed always in the config phase? That makes no sense!? WHY!
TODO: XTC Language; Can we change the $ template operator to work like Kotlin does and just nearly like Kotlin, but different?
TODO: Add a settings plugin that is also part of the distribution, which contains things like the github repository syntactic sugare, and maybe sugar for finding the local XDK installation and its repo.
TODO: Make sure forceRebuild = true flag work for xtcCompile and its task environment.
TODO: Gradle.useLogger - add a custom logger with timing, start and finish, indentation and levels, with possibilities to add outputs like a file or stderr. Configure through gradle properties?
TODO: Maven plugin from flatfile/distro repo. Add our own plugindefinitionspdec ?
TODO: Create a github template for the "simplest" xtc project possible
TODO: Add runXtcNative and compileXtcNative, actually model a local distribution in a build logic.kt class.
TODO: Get rid of the project delegate stuff, just extend project?
TODO: Add include and exclude patterns for the xtcCompile and xtcRun configurations. It should work for the former
  already, since it inherits a standard Gradle source task.

./xdk/build.gradle.kts: * TODO: This task should create symlinks for the launcher names to the right binaries.
./xdk/build.gradle.kts: * TODO better copying, even if it means hardcoding directory names.

./manualTests/build.gradle.kts:// TODO: Add modules { } dsl section to collect single module { } configurations, instead of listing them in the config as a sequence.
./javatools_launcher/build.gradle.kts: * TODO: We could add a mechanism to native compile this, but it would have to cross compile
./javatools/build.gradle.kts:// TODO: Move these to buildSrc, the XDK composite build does use them in some different places.

./javatools/build.gradle.kts:    from(file(xdkImplicitsPath)) // TODO Hack: this should be changed to use a consumable configuration, and/or moving javautils as a subproject, as it is never used standalone, just as part of a fat javatools jar.
TODO: SAVE THE BUILD SCAN FROM THE LATEST BUILD SOMEWHERE LOCAL WHERE WE CAN LOOK LATER. CONTAINER OUR OWN GRADLE ENTERPRISE SERVER.
