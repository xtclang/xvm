TODO runXtc/All should not fail for e.g. test when there is no test source set.
TODO: Fix the unicode depenency problems.
TODO: Add native launcher tasks.
TODO: is pruneBuildRepo executed always in the config phase? That makes no sense!? WHY!
TODO: XTC Language; Can we change the $ template operator to work like Kotlin does and just nearly like Kotlin, but different?
TODO: Add a settings plugin that is also part of the distribution, which contains things like the github repository syntactic sugare, and maybe sugar for finding the local XDK installation and its repo.
TODO: Implement a release action (including weaving the correct binary native launchers and symlinks), and publish tagged to GitHub, afterwards bumping to the next patch release version as a SNAPSHOT version.
TODO: Make sure forceRebuild = true flag work for xtcCompile and its task environment.
TODO: Gradle.useLogger - add a custom logger with timing, start and finish, indentation and levels, with possibilities to add outputs like a file or stderr. Configure through gradle properties?
TODO: Maven plugin from flatfile/distro repo. Add our own plugindefinitionspdec ?
TODO: Create a github template for the "simplest" xtc project possible
TODO: Add runXtcNative and compileXtcNative, actually model a local distribution in a build logic.kt class.
TODO: Get rid of the project delegate stuff, just extend project?
TODO: Add include and exclude patterns for the xtcCompile and xtcRun configurations. It should work for the former
  already, since it inherits a standard Gradle source task.
