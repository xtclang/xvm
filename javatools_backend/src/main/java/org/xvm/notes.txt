Ignore packages for now?


* org/xvm/XEC.java - entry point

* org/xvm/xtc - Read an XTC file support classes; ClassPart, *Part, CPool,Version,VerTree
* org/xvm/xtc/cons - "cons" things from XTC files
* org/xvm/xtc/AST  - "AST"  things from XTC files

* org/xvm/xtc/ClzBuilder, ModBuilder, Javac, XType, XValue,

* org/xvm/xec - generated class strings act "as if" loaded from here
* org/xvm/xec - runtime support classes (no ties with gen classes)
* org/xvm/xec/XClz - base class for gen'd classes.
  org/xvm/xec/??   - Common methods like TRACE, common enums... 
* org/xvm/xec/XRunClz - Runnable XClz
  org/xvm/xec/ecstasy/Iterable64 - extends XClz, implements Iterator<Long>
  org/xvm/xec/ecstasy/collections/Array<E> - extends XClz, implements array list
  org/xvm/xec/ecstasy/collections/Array64  - extends XClz, implements array list<long>


*XTC Modules- 
*- gen as org/xvm/xec/module.java, includes static init
*- includes main & run
*- which pass off to module/class run

*XTC module+class Class-
*- gen as org/xvm/xec/module.java

XTC lower class
 - gen as org/xvm/xec/module/CLASSNAME.java


#So multiMethod example:
#
#org/xvm/xec/Main.java       - extends xec.XClz; import default; run() { new Main.Main().run(); }
#org/xvm/xec/Main/Main.java  - extends Main;     import MLib.JLib; run() { console.log; call Lib.greeting(); }
#org/xvm/xec/Lib.java        - extends xec.Xclz; import default;  empty_static;
#org/xvm/xec/Lib/Lib.java    - extends Lib;      String greeting() {return "hello world"}

* Simple 1-class modules can keep their short form:
*   org/xvm/xec/Main.java
*   org/xvm/xec/Lib.java


* XType - intercepts Appendable<XXX>, TODO
        -                      <Char> MAPS TO interface xec/ecstasy/Appendable$Char
  TemplateAST
  - DefReg of ecstasy/text/StringBuffer <<-->> NEW JAVA xec/ecstasy/text/StringBufffer.java
  Every thing is either-
  - prim base: sb.p(prim)
  - else     : obj.appendTo(sb)  // Must call appendTo, so can be overridden by object


---------------------------
XTC Null is Java null.
XTC objects have a constructor, an assert & a finally.
XTC Obj construct sequence.

- Alloc raw memory
- Default init; Java 0s.  Maybe some XTC bits after this.
- - Replace Java null ptrs with typed TombStone, to avoid null-vs-#uninit confusion
- Constructs are called as user writes them; only called on child.
- - Operate on C struct flavor of memory
- - Can call any parent construct in any order, any number of times (0, 1 or many)
- - Fields must check for #uninit before use
- - - Int/Flt fields are pre-init/pre-zero
- - - Check Tombstone on reads & throw
- - Structs can escape, and be worked on by non-constructor methods & still must check #uninit
- - Check for #uninit at exit
- Call child assert, which auto-calls parent asserts
- Call child finally, which auto-calls parent finally in pre-order

Later Optimizations
- XTC MAY be able to declare "no uses of #uninit"
- XTC MAY be able to declare "no escapes"

------------------

Immutable
- XTC objs can be declared immutable at any time, via e.g. reflection
- Write to immutable objects must throw
- Current strat:
- - Set a immut bit.

- - Test bit before EVERY write



------------------
class B {
  String[] names;
  construct() {
    names = ["bob", "sue"]; // note: actually read from disk, not const pool value

    this.foo(); // compiler error

    // Cliff - TO DISCUSS
    (struct B) s = this; // extends Struct
    other.foo(s);  // Here foo tortures over time
    s.names = ["sue"];
  } finally {
    // Cliff - TO DISCUSS when does this get run?
    B b = this;
    this.foo();
  }

  assert() {
    // this gets called after the constructor before the finally
  }

  void foo() {...}
}

class D extends B {
  construct() {
    names = ["Cliff"];
    if (...) {
      construct B();
    } else {
      construct B(1,2,3);
    }

    // Cliff - TO DISCUSS
    (struct D) s = this; // extends Struct, extends (struct B)
  } finally {
    // Cliff - TO DISCUSS when does this get run?
    D d = this;
  }

  assert() {
    // this gets called after the constructor before the finally
  }
}

Call chain order -

D.construct()
  D.con1();
  B.construct() // in-order as user writes
  D.con2();
D.assert
  B.assert (pre/post either call)
(cast struct D to XTC D; set immutable bit)
D.finally
  B.finally (pre-order call)
