/**
 * This is the archetype Ecstasy module, the seed from which all Ecstasy code must derive,

 * type system, defining each of the intrinsically supported data types, and the various
 * structures and capabilities of the Ecstasy type system and runtime environment.
 * Additionally, a number of useful data structures and algorithms are included to promote
 * the productivity of developers writing Ecstasy code.
 *
 * All Ecstasy modules import this module automatically, as if they had the following line

 *
 *     package ecstasy import ecstasy.xtclang.org;
 *
 * This module is fully and completely self-referential, containing no references to other
 * modules, and no link-time or runtime dependencies.
