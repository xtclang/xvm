/**
 * This interface represents the capabilities that are common to every Ecstasy object. In Ecstasy,
 * "everything is an object", and every class is an implementation of this [Object] interface.
 *
 * An object can only be accessed and manipulated via a reference to that object, and every object reference will
 * contain _at least_ the methods of the [Object] interface. In other words, every reference will
 * have at least the methods [toString], [equals](Comparable.equals(Comparable)), and
 * [makeImmutable], as well as the [equals](Comparable.equals(CompileType, CompileType)) function
 * from the [Comparable] functional interface.
 *
 * Additional meta-information about the object is available through:
 * * The reference to the object, represented by the [Ref] interface;
 * * The [Type] of the object reference, which is provided by [Ref.Referent] and [Ref.type];
 *   and
 * * The [Class] of the object, which is accessible via the Type, unless the type has been
 *   masked by [Ref.maskAs<AsType>()].
