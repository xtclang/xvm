/**
 * A Timeout is used to constrain the wall-clock time limit for calls made to other services
 * from this service. Specifically, once a timeout is put in place, all service invocations that
 * originate from this service will carry the timeout, such that those service invocations will
 * need to complete within the remainder of that timeout, or risk a TimedOut exception being raised.
 *
 * The Timeout mechanism is a cooperative mechanism, and is not intended to be used as a strict
 * resource management mechanism. Rather, it is intended for uses in which returning with a bad
 * answer (or an exception) is preferable to not returning at all. Generally, timeouts are useful
 * for user-interactive systems, in which failing to respond within a reasonable period of time is
 * unacceptable, and for systems that need to assume the worst if an external process -- such as a
 * persistent storage system or network communication with a remote system -- takes an unexpectedly
 * long period of time.
 *
 * The timeout is stored on the current service and exposed as {@link Service.timeout}. When a new
 * timeout is created, it automatically registers itself with the current service using the {@link
 * Service.registerTimeout} method. Employing either a `using` or `try`-with-resources
 * block will automatically unregister the timeout at the conclusion of the block, causing all
 * of the potentially-asynchronous service invocations that occurred within the block to be infected
 * by the timeout. When the timeout unregisters itself, it re-registers whatever previous timeout it
 * replaced (if any).
 *
 * Timeouts _nest_. When a new timeout is created, it configures itself to use no more time than
 * remains on the current timeout. This allows the developer to create a new timeout without
 * concern that it is violating an existing timeout. In the following example, two different
 * time-outs (1 second and 500 milli-seconds) are used, but if there is less than 1 second remaining
 * on the current timeout for the current service, then the timeouts in the example will be reduced
 * in order to fit within that existing timeout:
 *
 *   // to obtain asynchronous results from other services, use future references for the return
 *   // values from methods on those services
 *   @Future Body body;
 *   @Future Ad   ad1;
 *   @Future Ad   ad2;
 *
 *   // async request for the page body, but don't wait more than 1000ms for it
 *   using (new Timeout(Duration:1S))
 *       {
 *       body = contentSvc.genBody();
 *
 *       // async request for two advertisements, but don't wait more than 500ms for either
 *       using (new Timeout(Duration:.5S))
 *           {
 *           ad1 = adSvc1.selectAd();
 *           ad2 = adSvc2.selectAd();
 *           }
 *       }
 *
 *   // handle time-outs and other exceptions using some default content
 *   ad1  = &ad1.handle(e -> blankAd);
 *   ad2  = &ad2.handle(e -> blankAd);
 *   body = &body.handle(e -> errPage(e));
 *
 *   // an attempt to dereference a future will automatically wait for the future to complete;
 *   // at this point, wait for the three separate results, and use them to render the page, but
 *   // regardless, try not to take more than 1000ms total for all three parts to complete
 *   return renderPage(body, ad1, ad2);
 *
 * If a service needs to begin a long-running task that is independent of the timeout that the
 * service is currently constrained by, construct an _independent_ timeout:
 *
 *   using (new Timeout(Duration:5H, True))
 *       {
 *       new LongRunningReports().begin();
 *       }
