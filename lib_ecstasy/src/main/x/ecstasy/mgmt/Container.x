/**
 * A Container is the fundamental domain of execution in Ecstasy, and represents the intersection of
 * a type system that defines the components of execution, with the conceptual machine on which that
 * execution occurs.
 *
 * All Ecstasy execution occurs within a container. To paraphrase Descartes: _laboro, ergo sum_ ("I
 * work, therefore I am"). The fact that Ecstasy code is executing is proof of the existence of the
 * container within which it executes, but generally, that is the only proof that exists from the
 * point of reference of the running code, because the existence of (and a reference to) the
 * container within which the code is executing is undiscoverable from within. The analogy to the
 * physical universe is apt, in that the domain is seemingly boundless from within, yet describable
 * and knowable only in terms of its contents and the behavior thereof.
 *
 * From outside of the container, though, the container is as real and fungible as any other object,
 * and its use is conceptually straight-forward:
 *
 * * A container is created by specifying the module (or modules) that will form its type system;
 *
 * * The modules (along with any dependencies) are loaded (if necessary) and linked to form an
 *   immutable type system for the container;
 *
 * * The container exposes a management and monitoring interface that allows the creator of (or any
 *   object with a reference to) the container to (i) specify constraints for the container, (ii)
 *   initiate execution within the container, (iii) enumerate the nested containers and services
 *   within the container, (iv) obtain run-time statistics for the resource utilization by the
 *   container, (v) persist a snap-shot of the runtime state of the container in a manner that the
 *   container could potentially be re-started from that point, and (vi) control the life cycle of
 *   the container, including pausing, resuming, and killing it;
 *
 * * The contents of the container are naturally visible to and manipulable by the creator of the
 *   container, just as the contents of the container are visible to and manipulable by the code
 *   running inside of the container; in other words, there is no security protection from the
 *   creator of the container, just as there is no security against other code that is loaded as
 *   part of the same container;
 *
 * * Since it is possible to create a new `Container` from Ecstasy code (and indeed, that is
 *   _conceptually_ the only way to create a container), it follows naturally that containers form
 *   a strict hierarchy, with each container nested beneath the container that created it, and with
 *   the containers that it directly creates nested under it; all of the rules and concepts related
 *   to the container are -- by design -- recursively consistent.
 *
 * A `Container`, like any object in Ecstasy, is prevented from being garbage-collected by either
 * its _activity_ or _by the presence of references to it_. As with any [service](Service), a
 * container is considered _active_ if it has any fibers; in the case of a container, this rule
 * means that if any service within the container has a fiber, then the container is considered to
 * be _active_. Similarly, as with any service, all references to a container or objects within the
 * container from outside of the container are _proxies_, and the existence of any such reference
 * would prevent the container from being garbage-collected. If code running within the container
 * registers for call-backs from services that are injected into the container, then those pending
 * potential callbacks would be references into the container, and as such, would prevent automatic
 * garbage-collection of the container; examples include `Timer` alarms and `Socket` connections.
