/**
 * Number represents the properties and operations available on every numeric type included in
 * Ecstasy.
 *
 * Numbers are constant values, represented internally as an array of bits; for example, an 8-bit
 * integer value for `3` is represented by the bits `00000011', in which the left-most bit is the
 * _Most Significant Bit_ (MSB) and the rightmost bit is the _Least Significant Bit_ (LSB).
 *
 * Arrays are normally left-to-right (or top-to-bottom) in nature, but bits of a number are often
 * identified in the opposite order; the Least Significant Bit (LSB) is often referred to as bit
 * number 0, and each bit of greater significance has a one-higher bit number than the last, with
 * the Most Significant Bit (MSB) of an n-bit number being bit number `n-1`. Since this is the
 * opposite of the order that the bits appear in the array of bits used to create a number, the
 * `Array.reversed()` method can be used to obtain an array in LSB-to-MSB order.
 *
 * Numbers can also be instantiated from an array of bytes, in a left-to-right order, as they would
 * appear when communicated over the network, or as they would be stored in a file. To obtain the
 * bytes from a number in the left-to-right order from a Number, use the `toByteArray()` method.
