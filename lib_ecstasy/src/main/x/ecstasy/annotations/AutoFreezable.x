/**
 * An annotation into a freezable class that indicates to the runtime that instances of that class should
 * be frozen automatically when necessary.
 *
 * This is intended to be used to make simple [Freezable] classes whose purpose is to carry
 * information across a service boundary, saving the developer from having to explicitly `freeze()`
 * or `makeImmutable()` on every call. As such, the objects are assumed, by default, to be designed
 * to freeze "in place"; the annotation constructor allows that assumption to be overridden:
 *
 *     @AutoFreezable(inPlace=False) class Message {...}
