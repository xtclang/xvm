/**
 * A SoftVar is used to make a reference into a soft reference. A soft reference is a reference
 * whose reference can be cleared by the garbage collector if the garbage collector decides that it
 * wants to reclaim the memory represented by the referent. Generally, it is expected that the
 * runtime will attempt to prioritize the retention of soft references that represent some
 * combination of smaller memory usage, more frequent usage, more recent usage, and (in the case of
 * the combination of SoftVar and LazyVar) more expensive-to-calculate values.
 *
 * In order to avoid the possibility of an unassigned reference becoming visible, the SoftVar must
 * be of a `Referent` that has a default value (such as [Nullable], with its default
 * value of `Null`), or it must be combined with [LazyVar] so that the value is
 * calculable on-demand.
 *
 * A SoftVar can have a `notify` notification function provided in its construction that is
 * enqueued into the service's runtime event queue each time that the soft reference is cleared by
 * the garbage collector; see [Service.pendingRuntimeEvents] and [Service.dispatchRuntimeEvents].
