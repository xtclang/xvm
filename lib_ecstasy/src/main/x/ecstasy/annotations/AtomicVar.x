/**
 * An atomic reference is one whose referent can be accessed across service boundaries without
 * invoking the service containing the reference. The reason that the reference can be accessed
 * across service boundaries is that the runtime treats an atomic reference _as a service_. (Only
 * service proxies and immutable objects can permeate the service boundary.)
 *
 * There are a few reasons to use atomic references:
 * * As a light-weight service: A service that exposes mutable storage of a referent.
 * * As a synchronous portal into a service: A service can expose real-time information through
 *   a property on the service's interface that is declared as an AtomicRef.
 * * As a means for coordination through atomic mutations: Allowing multiple services to safely
 *   share and aggregate information.
 *
 * Consider the following example that illustrates the first two use cases:
 *
 *   service LongRunningTask(WorkItem[] work) {
 *       // Even while the processBatch() method is running, other services can query
 *       // the percentDone value, and monitor its progress from 0% to 100%
 *       @Atomic Int percentDone;
 *
 *       void processBatch() {
 *           Int lastPercent = 0;
 *           for (Int i : 0..work.length) {
 *               Int percent = i * 100 / work.length;
 *               if (percent != lastPercent) {
 *                   percentDone = percent;
 *                   lastPercent = percent;
 *               }
 *
 *               // actually do the work ...
 *               WorkItem work = work[i];
 *               // ...
 *           }
 *       }
 *   }
 *
 * Consider the following example that illustrates the second and third use cases
 * (also see AtomicIntNumber for the specifics of the Int operation overrides):
 *
 *   static service Statistics {
 *       @Atomic Int hits;
 *       @Atomic Int misses;
 *   }
 *
 *   // somewhere else in various other services
 *   if (cache.contains(key)) {
 *       // atomically increment the hit count
 *       ++Statistics.hits;
 *   } else {
 *       // atomically increment the miss count
 *       ++Statistics.misses;
 *   }
