/**
 * A service is a class that represents the possibility for asynchronous and/or concurrent
 * execution.
 *
 * A service is a programming abstraction for an independent _von Neumann machine_. While a service
 * is _not_ a thread in the traditional programming sense, a service does represent many of the
 * conceptual elements of a thread of execution. In its simplest form, a service could be imagined
 * as a combination of a work queue and a thread, in which any call from outside of the context of
 * the service (i.e. any call into the service from any other conceptual thread of execution) is
 * converted into a work item placed into the work queue and an associated future result provided to
 * the caller as a return value.
 *
 * As a conceptual thread of execution, a service incorporates a number of important aspects and
 * responsibilities:
 *
 * * A service represents the ownership of some amount of dynamic memory. Allocations that occur
 *   within the context of a service are made from that dynamic memory, and those allocations are
 *   managed by the service. As a consequence of this, a service is responsible for the garbage
 *   collection (GC) of the unreachable objects within that dynamic memory. As a benefit, a service
 *   provides real-time information related to its memory foot-print.
 * * A service has a natural surface boundary. Calls originating within another service must enter
 *   this service boundary, and calls from this service to another service must exit this service
 *   boundary. Only two specific types of objects can permeate the boundary: Immutable objects, and
 *   services. What this means in practice is that all parameters to an invocation of a service
 *   method, and all return values from the same, must either be service references or references to
 *   immutable objects.
 * * Functionality from the service can be passed through the boundary _as a service_. In other
 *   words, when a function is passed out through the service boundary, it is automatically
 *   transformed into a proxy representation of that functionality within this service context.
 *   Similarly, when the proxy is invoked, the invocation is treated as if it were an invocation
 *   against the service itself. Lastly, if the proxy is passed back _as a parameter_ to the service
 *   from whence it originated, the proxy is automatically transformed into a reference to the
 *   original function (i.e. the proxy is _unwrapped_). It is also possible that a function is also
 *   an immutable (for example, if all of its captures are immutable), in which case the function
 *   _may_ be passed as an immutable and not as a proxy back to the function in the calling service.
 * * Immutable objects passed through the surface boundary may be transferred either as immutable
 *   objects, or under certain circumstances they may be passed by proxy. If passed as an immutable
 *   object, and if the object is located within the memory managed by the calling service, then a
 *   copy of the object may be created either in the memory managed by the destination service, or
 *   in a memory area dedicated solely to immutable objects and shared by all of the services within
 *   the current {@see Container}. Immutable objects passed among services within the same container
 *   are expected to be passed as immutable objects, while immutable objects passing through a
 *   container boundary may be converted to proxies in order to preserve the seal of the container.
 * * The decisions as to the degree of asynchronicity and/or concurrency for the service are managed
 *   entirely by the runtime. The rationale is that knowledge of available hardware and software
 *   threads will only be known by the runtime, and the actual runtime usage of an particular
 *   service will indicate how that service can be most efficiently executed, particularly in
 *   environments in which the resources are being explicitly managed (and perhaps constrained).
 * * The service has an independent life-cycle. A service can be explicitly shut down (cleanly) or
 *   killed (without giving the service a chance to cleanly shut down) in order to terminate its
 *   life cycle and release any resources that it holds. As a result of all of the service's
 *   resources being owned by the service itself, a service can be shut down independently of all
 *   other services, and its resources can easily be reclaimed; however, since it is likely that
 *   other services still hold proxy references to the service, subsequent invocation through those
 *   proxies will result in an exception.
 * * The runtime itself may provide events to the service, enqueuing them so that if the service is
 *   running, the event does not interrupt the execution. These events will be automatically
 *   processed by a service when it is not busy processing, such as when the current service
 *   invocation returns, calls [yield], or even potentially when another service is invoked by
 *   this service. Runtime events may be processed even if [reentrant] evaluates to `False`.
 *   Runtime events include only:
 * * * Future completion events, for previous asynchronous invocations initiated by this service.
 * * * Timeout notification for the currently executing service invocation, although the runtime
 *     may temporarily suppress these notifications within a [SynchronizedSection].
 * * * `@Soft` and `@Weak` reference-cleared notifications.
