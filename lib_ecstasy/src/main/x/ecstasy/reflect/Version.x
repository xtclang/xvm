/**
 * The Version class is used to specify a module version. A version is a sequence of version
 * indicators (typically numbers), arranged from most "major" to most "minor". For example, for
 * the prototypical version number "1.0", the major version is "1" and the minor version is "0".
 *
 * A version number indicates one of: a _base_ version, a _subsequent_ version of a version, or
 * a _revision_ of a version. A version number is represented as a dot-delimited string of integer
 * values; for example, version "1" is a potential base version number, version "2" is a subsequent
 * version of version "1", and version "1.1" is a revision of version "1".
 *
 * For each integer in a version number, the first integer is considered the most significant
 * version indicator, and each following integer is less significant, with the last integer
 * being the least significant version indicator. If the least significant version indicator is
 * zero, then the version is identical to a version that does not include that least significant
 * version indicator; in other words, version "1", version "1.0", and version "1.0.0" (etc.) all
 * refer to the same identical version. For purposes of comparison:
 *
 * * The actual version `v<sub>A</sub>` is **identical to** the requested version `v<sub>R</sub>`
 *   iff after removing every trailing (least significant) "0" indicator, each version indicator
 *   from the most significant to the least significant is identical; in other words, version
 *   "1.2.1" is identical only to version "1.2.1" (which is identical to version "1.2.1.0").
 *
 * * The actual version `v<sub>A</sub>` is **substitutable for** the requested version
 *   `v<sub>R</sub>` iff each version indicator of the requested version from the most
 *   significant to the least significant is identical to the corresponding version indicator
 *   in the actual version, or if the first difference encountered is on the least significant
 *   version indicator of the requested version, and the version indicator in the actual version is
 *   greater than the version indicator in the requested version; in other words, version "1.2",
 *   "1.2.1", "1.2.1.7", "1.3", and "1.7.5" are substitutable for version "1.2", but "2.0", "2.1",
 *   and "3" are **not** substitutable for version "1.2".
 *
 * * In the previous example, to use only one of the versions that begins with "1.2", the
 *   requested version `v<sub>R</sub>` should be specified as "1.2.0"; versions "1.2",
 *   "1.2.1", and "1.2.1.7" are substitutes for 1.2.0, but **not** versions "1.3", "2.0", and "2.1".
 *
 * * Pre-release version numbers are encoded specially, and impact the substitutability rules
 *   significantly. The version "1.2beta3" is encoded as "1.2.-2.3"; it is substitutable for version
 *   "1.1", but it is explicitly **not** substitutable for version "1.2" -- because it is a
 *   pre-release of version "1.2". However, version "1.2" _is_ substitutable for version "1.2beta3".
 *   The pre-release indicator means that the immediately preceding version indicator is _less than_
 *   its value indicates; for example, version "1.2beta3" is less than (precedes) version "1.2", but
 *   it is greater than version "1.2alpha", "1.2alpha7", "1.2beta" and version "1.2beta2", and it is
 *   less than version "1.2beta4" and version "1.2rc".
 *
 * The Version design supports [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] (https://semver.org/), and adherence
 * to that specification is encouraged. However, the use of Semantic Versioning is a choice, and
 * while this Version class does _support_ Semantic Versioning, it does not _enforce_ it.
 * Additionally, this design constrains the use of alpha-numeric forms in two different ways:
 *
 * * Only six alpha-numeric forms are supported ("CI", "Dev", "QC", "alpha", "beta", and "rc"),
 *   with the first three representing internal versions and the remainder representing publishable
 *   versions. (The use of uppercase names for the first three is not accidental; ASCII uppercase
 *   precedes ASCII lowercase, which achieves compliance with the ASCII ordering rules specified by
 *   the Semantic Versioning specification.)
 *
 * * A Version can only contain **one** of the alpha-numeric pre-release specifiers, and it must
 *   occur at the end of the Version with an optional numeric counter appended; i.e. there can be
 *   no subsequent "dot" indicators after the alpha-numeric pre-release specifier. For example,
 *   "2.0.0-alpha" and "2.0.0-beta3" are both legal, but neither "2-alpha-beta3" nor "2.0.0-beta3.5"
 *   are legal.
 *
 * As specified by Semantic Versioning, build metadata is appended to the end of the version string
 * after a plus sign. Build metadata is retained by, but ignored by the Version class. The examples
 * from the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification are all legal Version examples:
 * "1.0.0-alpha+001", "1.0.0+20130313144700", "1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85". The Semantic Versioning
 * specification states that only A..Z, a..z, 0..9, and '-' may occur in the build metadata, but the
 * examples given also include '.', so Ecstasy considers the '.' to be legal in build metadata.
