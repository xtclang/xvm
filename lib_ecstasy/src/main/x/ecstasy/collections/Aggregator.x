/**
 * The `Aggregator` allows for a customizable reduction and aggregation state machine to be
 * implemented. The design of the API is intended to encourage `Aggregator` implementations to be
 * stateless and/or immutable; implementations should be `const`, if possible.
 *
 * The "simple" aggregation process, represented by this API, is composed of two stages:
 *
 * 1. Accumulation: The `Aggregator` provides a stateful and mutable [Accumulator] via the [init]
 *    method, into which all of the `Element` values are accumulated.
 *
 * 2. Reduction: The `Aggregator` is then given that same `Accumulator`, as part of the request to
 *    [reduce] the accumulated `Element` value to a `Result` value.
 *
 * An `Aggregator` that can perform this process in parallel should implement the
 * [ParallelAggregator] interface.
 *
 * A collection of commonly used Aggregator implementations are located in the
 * `aggregate.xtclang.org` module.
