/**
 * As part of the Ecstasy JIT implementation targeting the JVM, this class represents an Ecstasy
 * TypeSystem, which is a collection of Ecstasy modules that are linked together. This class is
 * responsible for generating the Java ClassFiles for the Ecstasy code represented by this
 * TypeSystem.
 *
 * In the simple case, creating a TypeSystem is about specifying a main module (e.g. "load my app,
 * please!") which automatically drags in the shared Ecstasy core module ("ecstasy.xtclang.org"),
 * and that's it. But creating a TypeSystem is potentially far more complex than this simple
 * example, and can be an iterative and recursive process, which at each stage must resolve
 * significant questions:
 *
 * * Each module has a set of modules that it depends upon, and those dependencies can be required
 *   or optional, and in the case of optional dependencies, the "optional" indicator means only that
 *   the dependency is explicitly supported, while the "desired" indicator implies that the
 *   dependency _should_ be used if it's available; in both cases, there is an inclusion decision to
 *   be made.
 *
 * * Every Module has a dependency on the `ecstasy.xtclang.org` Module, and may have dependencies on
 *   other core Ecstasy library Modules. These core library Modules must be unique within the
 *   runtime, i.e. loaded only once, in order to ensure that the .
 *
 * * Each module that needs to be loaded may have any number of versions available, so if the
 *   decision is made to load that module (either because it's required -- which implies an
 *   affirmative decision -- or because it's optional and an explicit decision is made to load it),
 *   then a further decision must be made as to which version of that module should be used. The
 *   additional dependencies that the yet-to-be-loaded module introduces can vary across its
 *   versions, so until the version to load has been decided, the additional dependencies (including
 *   optional dependencies to decide upon) are unknown.
 *
 * * Each module already selected for inclusion in the TypeSystem may limit and/or influence the
 *   version decision for each additional module being loaded. Each module can specify its own
 *   version constraints on other modules. So as each module is loaded, new constraints may need to
 *   be incorporated into future decisions.
 *
 * * Additionally, attempting to load a module as part of the TypeSystem may reveal requirements or
 *   constraints that are incompatible with decisions that were already made in the formation of the
 *   TypeSystem up to this point. Encountering such a condition means that the TypeSystem is invalid
 *   and cannot be altered into a valid state; to "fix" this requires a new TypeSystem to be built,
 *   but with a different set of decisions along the way to avoid coming to the same dead end.
 *
 * * Some modules are provided from existing TypeSystems to the new TypeSystem. These are called
 *   "shared modules", because they are being shared into the new TypeSystem. The version and
 *   dependency decisions for shared modules were already made, and thus the shared modules must be
 *   consistent (in terms of dependencies) with the modules in the new TypeSystem. Some decisions
 *   made previously when loading those shared modules may be fundamentally inconsistent with the
 *   TypeSystem being formed, which means that the TypeSystem is already invalid.
 *
 * * Modules can also contain conditional elements predicated on a set of defined names (see the
 *   Ecstasy `@Iff` annotation), such as "test" (see `@Test`) and "debug" (see `@Debug`). These
 *   names must be specified (either positively or negatively) before any modules referring to them
 *   are resolved; all subsequent modules loaded within the TypeSystem must be resolved using the
 *   same defined name decisions to avoid potential conflicts across modules.
 *
 * * Each TypeSystem has a main module. It is specified after providing the set of shared Modules.
 *
 * * After the main Module has been specified, then additional modules can be specified. Additional
 *   modules will be split out into their own TypeSystems to the extent possible, in order to allow
 *   them to be reused by other TypeSystems without dragging in any unnecessary (and potentially
 *   conflicting) baggage. Reusing ModuleLoaders implies reusing Java classes, which can (in theory)
 *   save a huge amount of memory (not to mention the amount of work saved) in a multi-tenanted
 *   runtime.
 *
 * * After all Modules have been specified, then the TypeSystem can be linked.
