/**
 * Represents any of the various XVM structures, which are hierarchical in nature, and include such
 * structures as modules, namespaces, classes, methods, properties, and so on.
 * <p/>
 * The purpose of an XVM structure is to encapsulate a broad range of complexity behind a relatively
 * uniform surface area, which is a fairly significant challenge. Quite a few design decisions are
 * hidden behind that limited surface area, but even with significant effort, the surface area has
 * expanded beyond what one would consider "small". Hereunder is an attempt to capture a few of the
 * rationales for the design:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The design of the binary structure that is emitted by the Ecstasy compiler (and consumed by the
 * XVM) is hierarchical, and thus there is a natural correlation to the hierarchical tree of XVM
 * structures.</li>
 *
 * <li>As the binary structure is both emitted and consumed, it is necessary to be able to persist
 * the runtime structure into a binary structure, and to be able to load that binary structure into
 * the runtime structure. The XVM structure thus can be constructed from a stream, and persisted to
 * a stream.</li>
 *
 * <li>A decision was made to lock each node to a particular XVM structure hierarchy, such that a
 * node from one module (for example) could not simply be "added" to a different module. This is a
 * consequence of the tree structure being maintained from the leaf upwards by way of immutable
 * references within the tree from node to parent. This allows a node to assume that it will only
 * ever exist within the confines of the parent that it was introduced to at construction, and that
 * guarantee is recursively enforced all the way to the root. As a result, a node may be able to
 * optimize a number of its responsibilities, for example by caching information that is immutable
 * as the result of its lineage being fixed.</li>
 *
 * <li>Since the parent of a node cannot be changed after construction, it does mean that the node
 * has to be "born to" the right parent. This lends itself to an API style in which a parent exposes
 * factory-like methods that are responsible for the instantiation of any child nodes.</li>
 *
 * <li>The {@link #getContaining()} method provides access to the parent, while the {@link
 * #getContained()} method provides the children. In general, the only XVM Structure without a
 * parent (i.e. the only root structure) is the {@link FileStructure}, which acts as an envelope for
 * XVM Structures. Many XVM Structures, such as classes and methods, have an identity that is unique
 * (at least within the scope of their parent), which is represented by the value returned from the
 * {@link #getIdentityConstant()} method.</li>
 *
 * <li>The manner in which a hierarchy is created from a binary is called disassembly. Disassembly
 * is triggered in a recursive manner by constructing a {@link FileStructure FileStructure}, which
 * represents an outer-most "envelope" for XVM structures. The result of disassembly should be equal
 * to the XVM structure from which the binary was originally created from. Furthermore, the result
 * should itself be mutable, and subsequently persistable; that means that a binary can be
 * constituted (disassembled) into an XVM structure, modified, and persisted, supporting a wide
 * range of tool chain capabilities.</li>
 *
 * <li>The manner in which a hierarchy is transformed into a binary is called assembly. Assembly is
 * a two-phase process. In the first phase, the hierarchy is traversed, and every XVM Structure in
 * the hierarchy registers the constant values (if any) that it uses. After the first phase, the
 * constants in the constant pool that are unused can be discarded, and the pool can be ordered in a
 * way that places the most-used constants first (which reduces the sum-size of the variably-sized
 * integers used to specify constant identities). Once the constants and their order are finalized,
 * then the XVM Structures recursively write their structures out to create the binary (the
 * serialized form).</li>
 *
 * <li>The XVM Structure also supports conditional structure inclusion, which is a "link-time"
 * capability that corresponds to the type of functionality that one can achieve with a language
 * <i>pre</i>-processor in other languages. Among other things, it allows the resulting (resolved)
 * XVM structure to differ based on the presence and/or the version of various other libraries,
 * based on any number of arbitrary named link-time options, and based on the version of <i>this</i>
 * module. It is a requirement that each and every possible combination of conditions results in a
 * <b>verifiable</b> module, i.e. one that is correct according to the XVM specification. To
 * accomplish conditional structure inclusion, each XVM structure in the hierarchy can have a
 * {@link ConditionalConstant ConditionalConstant} associated with it.</li>
 * </ul>
