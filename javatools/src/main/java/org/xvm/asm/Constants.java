     * required to load the module correctly. An implementation of the XVM is able to support one or
     * more versions of the XVM specification; when it reads an ".xtc" module file, it verifies that
     * it supports the XVM version required by the file.
     *
     * When the Ecstasy compiler (the "xcc" command) emits an ".xtc" module file, it stamps a target
     * XVM version onto the file. All tools that read and/or modify ".xtc" module files must respect
     * the version contract.
     *
     * In this XVM implementation written in Java, the ".xtc" module files are read by the
     * {@link FileStructure} class. When a FileStructure loads ("deserializes") an ".xtc" module
     * file, it verifies that the version stamped on the file is supported by this implementation.
