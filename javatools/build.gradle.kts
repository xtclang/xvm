 * TODO: Someone please determine if this is something we should fix or not:

 * We add the implicits.x file to the resource set, to both make it a part of the javatools.jar + available.
 * IntelliJ may warn that we have a "duplicate resource folder" if this is executed by a Run/Debug configuration.
 * This is because lib_ecstasy is the place where these resources are originally placed. I'm not sure if
 * they need to be there to be compiled into the ecstasy.xtc binary, in order for the launchers to work, or
 * if they only need to be in the javatools.jar. If the latter is the case, we should move them. If the
 * former is the case, they should be resolved from the the built ecstasy.xtc module on the module path
 * anyway.
 *
 * We also need to refer to the "mack" module during runtime in the debugger. I suppose we can't access that
 * due to a similar reason as above - IntelliJ needs a reference to it to be able to invoke it in
 * the debug session, and it resides in a different module too (javatools_turtle). Seems weird that it
 * doesn't get that from the ecstasy.xtc file that actually IS on the module path in the debug run.
