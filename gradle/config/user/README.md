In some cases it's preferable for individual GitHub / Org users to keep configuration under source control.
This directory was intended to contain sub-directories with names corresponding to the GitHub user and XTC
contributor who uses them.

Most configuration will be common to the entire team, after it has been agreed upon, probably meaning that 
this directory will contain very little content, but it is feasible that at least some individual configuration
is kept under source control, where it actually provides better ergonomics.
