/**
 * This is the manualTests project.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE: This is not your "Hello world" app playground.
 *
 * Please use another project directory and/or GitHub repository for that, with the XDK as either
 * an included build, or as published artifacts.
 *
 * ManualTests is a standalone XTC project, which should only depend on the XDK.
 *
 * Depending on the "manualTests" properties set in ../gradle.properties, this project
 * will either be an includedBuild in the XDK build, but will only configure, not resolve or
 * compile anything, if not connected to the lifecycle, which cached is pretty much zero overhead.
 * Excluding manual tests completely from the composite build will make it invisible in an IDE,
 * (not just for the build lifecycle)
 *
 * Either way, you can always run these tasks from the CLI (or if you have the build included
 * from inside IntelliJ, and actually debug and test these tasks and the XDK implementation code
 * in the IDE).
 *
 *   ./gradlew build should be used to compile this project, not the explicit compile task.
 *
 *   ./gradlew :manualTests:compile<SourceSet>Xtc (will compile the source set "SourceSet",
 *              for main, compileXtc is the task by convention)
 *   ./gradlew :manualTests:runXtc (runs any modules in the global xtcRun extension, no-op if none)
 *   ./gradlew :manualTests:<other run tasks> (shows how to override configuration in xtcRun with
 *              your own modules to run)
 */

/**
 * PLUGIN SECTION.
 *
 * These are resolved through the Gradle version catalog mechanism. A version catalog
 * is a single source of truth for dependent artifacts for a Gradle oroject. For the XVM repo,
 * there is a "global" version catalog under $compositeBuildRootDirectory/gradle/libs/libs.versions.html.
 * This makes it possible to alias artifacts to type safe (compile time knowable) hierarchical names.
 * For example, "libs.plugins.xtc" will resolve to "org.xtclang:xtc-plugin:<xvm version>".
 * This, in turn, means that the build should install that artifact with that version. It will look
 * in any repositories you have specified. For example, if you have a section like
 *
 * repositories {
 *    mavenCentral()
 * }
 *
 * in your project settings, or defined in the build file (if you can, it is recommended to keep it in
 * settings (for a best-practise example, please see the xtc-template-app project), the build will look
 * for the artifact in any local caches, and if not found, then ask the mavenCentral artifact repo
 * to if it knows about it and downloads/caches it. Basically, for any artifact on which you depend,
 * you need to know group, id and version, to fully resolve it. Sometimes you are only interested in
 * resolving any version, or latest version, or a version range, or a version with a specific Git tag, etc.
 * To see how that works, please refer to the Maven or Gradle user guides.
 *
 * Gradle also supports "included builds". This means that any artifact identifier can be substituted
 * with source control tree for a project that builds that artifact. This makes it possible for the XVM
 * to partially build and verify itself, and it decouples paths, project modes and other things from
 * configuration. Any change you will do in the XVM will "pretend" to be an artifact to its dependencies,
 * if their settings contain that particular project as an includedBuild. Hence, building the manualTests
 * module, will ensure that the plugin and the XDK are versioned, built and resolved from their code trees
 * in the XVM repo. But the build doesn't have to know about that. For all it knows, it just resolves
 * a named and versioned artifact. This build could be torn out and turn into a separate project and
 * still resolve the artifacts for any configured repository, without changing a line of code.

/**
 * Applying the XTC plugin, adds a couple of default extensions to the project: xtcCompile and xtcRun
 * are the only ones that may be necessary to care about, if you are working an XTC project build.
 * The "xtcCompile" extension contains common configuration for all XTC compilation tasks in
 * the current project. The "xtcRun" extensions contains common configuration for all XTC runner tasks
 * in a project. Every XtcCompleTask and XtcRunTask will inherit these configurations, but it's possible
 * to override any value in the extension on a per-task basis in the task configuration.
 *
 * Applying the XTC plugin to a Gradle project creates a few tasks by default. This is the pattern used
 * by most Gradle language plugins for compiled languages. These are the once that the XTC programmer
 * may be interested in:
 *
 * 1) The compile tasks for each source set
 * 2) The run tasks for all known modules.
 *
 * A compile task is added for each source set. Just like for other language plugins that use source sets,
 * we have a default source set for xtc code called "main" and one called "test" (currently not
 * used for much). The name of a compile task is derived from the name of the source set it will
 * compile, and upon detecting changes, recompile. Hence, if you have a "test" source set, you
 * will be given a "compileTestXtc" task, just as it would work with Java, Scala, Clojure etc.
 * For the default source set (by convention always renamed "main"), the task will just be called
 * "compileXtc", just like the default Java plugin compile task for the main source set is called
 * "compileJava".  Since the plugin currently creates XTC main and test source sets by default, you
 * will get compile tasks for both of these, even if they are empty. If you declare your own
 * source sets above, e.g. "negativeTests", you will get a compile task and run tasks for that too.
 *
 * Compile and run tasks can be created as you wish, like the examples below. The xtcCompile tasks
 * and xtcRun tasks can override any property from the extensions.
 *
 * NOTE: In Gradle, properly set up, any task and configuration in a build relies on implicitly
 * or explicitly defined inputs and outputs. Should they no longer hash to the same values, the task
 * cannot be cached. Otherwise, a task may be skipped and use its cached values. This also means
 * that you should never have to call any cleanup tasks, or any tasks that create dependencies of
 * another task in a correctly implemented Gradle build. This may confuse some users that come from
 * other languages. For example, in C/C++, a "clean" task in a Makefile will delete everything that
 * has be built, and a following build will start from scratch. The "clean" task in the Gradle build
 * lifecycle does the same, i.e. by default deletes everything a project has built, but AS LONG AS
 * YOU HAVE THE BUILD CACHE ENABLED YOUR NEXT BUILD WILL STILL REUSE CACHED ARTIFACTS, IF THEIR
 * INPUTS AND OUTPUTS ARE UNCHANGED. This is the whole point of the Gradle build cache, and XTC
 * respects those semantics, as a Gradle citizen should. So, for example, to create a distribution
 * of the XDK (./gradlew installDist), this is the only task you should need to code. If any
 * of its dependencies are gone, or have changed so that their inputs and outputs now differ,
 * it will be re-run, but otherwise, its build data will just be retrieved from the build cache.
 * "./gradlew clean" amd then "./gradlew build" is an anti-pattern, and if your build requires
 * these to work properly, that is a bug that should be reporoted to the build script author.
 *
 * To see more information on why a task is re-run, skipped or retrieved from the build cache,
 * you can run Gradle with the --info flag.
