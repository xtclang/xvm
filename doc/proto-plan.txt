- add a ReentrantLock for the ServiceContext to allow for an optimistic (message-less) context switch
    - DaemonPool to acquire the lock prior to nextFiber() call
    - ServiceContext.sendXyz() to set a target ServiceContext reference that would be used by
      DaemonPool to attempt to switch to another context
    - native code should be able to tryLock another context for a quick operation
      (e.g. Buffer<Byte> to be locked by a FileChannel)

- Stack overflow (fiber depth + frame depth within a fiber or cross-fiber frame depth)

- createConst() processing for Set, Map etc.

- Move op-code: "safe wrapper" logic

- ServiceContext - the "register..." APIs are "fiber local" -- unless called from the outside

- TypeInfo.findCallable() - use the same approach as Expression.findMethod()

- native optimization Stringable methods on xInt*, xUInt*, etc.

- consider a FormalTypeConstant instead of TerminalType(PropertyConstant)

-- tuple support
   - InvocationExpression - needs to generate _xT ops (i.e. it must be able to testFit & validate for a tuple type)
   - verify (and test) the logic in ReturnStatement that gens RETURN_T
   - assignment w/ multi-LVal needs to testFit for Tuple if testFit for multi fails
     (and use Expression.packedExpression and unpackedExpressions for code gen?)

- finish nesting call chain support

- Lazy property on an immutable object must not produce a mutable value

- compiler to verify that const properties are Orderable

- compiler to verify "all or nothing" implementation for funky interfaces

- use unique name for private properties
    {
    const Point(Int x, Int y)
        protected/private Int x;
        private Int y;

        void report()
            {
            console.println($"x={x}; y={y}");
            }
        }

    const NamedPoint(String name, Int x, Int y)
            extends Point(2*y, x + 1)
        {
        @Override
        void report()
            {
            console.println($"x={x}; y={y}"); // not the same y
            super();
            }
        }
    }

- allow NEW_G to use dynamic type; that would allow the following:
    Array createArray(Type type)
        {
        return new Array<type.DataType>();
        }

- run-time to validate that immutable objects passing through the "membrane" belongs to the
  recipient's type system

- generic type resolution for a turtle type should be Tuple<Type<A>,Type<B>, ...> instead of Tuple<A, B, ...>


$$$$$$$$$$ DEFERRED ISSUES $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

- TemplateRegistry and TypeComposition could be mutated by different threads
    (hence the use of ConcurrentHashMap in TemplateRegistry and synchronization in TypeComposition)

- DelegatingIterator could use delegation, but how to describe the delegating type?
