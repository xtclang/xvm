# Should we rebuild the unicode files from fresh templates as part of the XDK build?
# (Note: this modifies source control files in the project.)
# org.xtclang.unicode.rebuild=false

# Should we sign the plugin and XDK artifacts that are published?
# Requires external/secret properties "org.xtclang.signing.[keyId, password, secretKeyRingFile]"
#
# TODO: This is not required until we start with signed publications, for example to mavenCentral()
#  and other places it is required.

# Should we do a sanity check that we can execute a sample XTC application as
# part of the XDK build? Later this will be moved into the unit test cycle.
#
# Example use case to enable for one build: "ORG_XTCLANG_BUILD_SANITY_CHECK_RUNTIME=true ./gradlew build --scan"
#
# The "forceRebuild" sub property is only relevant if the master property without the forceRebuild
# suffix is set to true.
#
# (Currently the only automated unit tests during the build are for Java
#  modules, but this will change when we enable Plugin unit testing, XUnit or
#  other XTC test methodologies.)

# Should we delete an existing local distribution before creating a new one? Note that
# running the "installLocalDist" task always backs up any existing local installation to
# the build directory before it runs, regardless of if we allow overwrites or not.
# Setting this flag to "true" just writes the new distribution to the existing local
# distribution folder, without removing any of the files. The default is "true".
org.xtclang.build.allowOverwriteLocalDist=true

# Force republications of Gradle plugins every build, without explicitly changing versions.

# Should install build the distExe by default - currently requires running in an environment
# or container where 'makensis' with the EnVar plugin is installed and available.
