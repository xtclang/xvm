# GitHub runner workflow for building, verifying and testing the XVM repo.

# It also does some quick sanity check that we can provide release artifacts. This latter part
# will be implemented in much better detail when we have a marge to master and minimal effort
# GitHub release plugin integration, so we can automate release generation.

# TODO: Add a release workflow, and a distribution creation workflow. Reuse parts of the
#   "xdk-release" repo, that can run the cross product of aarch64, amd64, Linux, Windows and
#   MacOS, including creating the Windows "exe" installer, on any platform with Nsis.
#
# TODO: Add workflow jobs in another GitHub workflow configuration that builds SNAPSHOT releases
#   when a PR is merged into master.
#
# TODO: Discuss what other kinds of GitHub workflow actions we need. This can be anything
#   from cron jobs that run every night, to containerization tests/efforts/creations.
#
# TODO: Retain more build information than the defaults (log output and build scan links). I.e.
#   configure any build output files that we may want to inspect to be retained as well.
#   @see https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/main/setup-gradle/README.md#github-dependency-graph-support
#
# TODO: Set up Discord channel chat messages, when an action is started, successful or fails.
#
# TODO: Verify that the build jobs run both with and without the build cache. Since it takes
#   time to rebuild the cache, the clean cache run should be a separate workflow, and it may be
#   a good idea to run it only on pull requests, not on every push, or something like that.
#   Another option is to have a GitHub cron job action, that nukes the caches every night, so that
#   at least the first GitHub workflow of the day is known to build with a clean cache.
#
# TODO: File these TODOs as issues in the GitHub repository.
