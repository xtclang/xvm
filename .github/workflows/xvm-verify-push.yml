#
# GitHub runner workflow for building, verifying and testing the XVM repo.
#
# It also does some quick sanity check that we can provide release artifacts. This latter part
# will be implemented in much better detail when we have a marge to master and minimal effort
# GitHub release plugin integration, so we can automate release generation.
#
# TODO: Add a release workflow, and a distribution creation workflow. Reuse parts of the
#   "xdk-release" repo, that can run the cross product of aarch64, amd64, Linux, Windows and
#   MacOS, including creating the Windows "exe" installer, on any platform with Nsis.
#
# TODO: Add workflow jobs in another GitHub workflow configuration that builds SNAPSHOT releases
#   when a PR is merged into master.
#
# TODO: Discuss what other kinds of GitHub workflow actions we need. This can be anything
#   from cron jobs that run every night, to containerization tests/efforts/creations.
