/**
 * The `Scheduler` service handles pending [DBProcessor] processing, which enables the deferred
 * asynchronous behavior ("asynchronous triggers") and the scheduled processing capabilities of the
 * database.
 *
 * During a transaction, including during the "deferred" portion, and the validate, rectify, and
 * distribution phases, items may be _scheduled_, i.e. added to the queues of various DBProcessor
 * objects in the database. Like any other uncommitted transactional data, this is collected within
 * the various ObjectStore instances related to those various DBProcessor instances, and held in
 * a [Changes](ObjectStore.Changes) record, associated with (i.e. keyed by) the uncommitted
 * transaction ID.
 *
 * The most difficult aspect of the DBProcessor / TxManager / Scheduler interaction to understand is
 * that the behavior is truly asynchronous (and concurrent), and simultaneously the behavior is
 * truly transactional. These two concepts are naturally in conflict. What this means is that, from
 * the point of view of the application, all changes to the state of the DBProcessor occur
 * transactionally. This includes pausing and resuming the DBProcessor, scheduling and rescheduling
 * and unscheduling messages, processing messages, deciding whether to retry messages, and
 * abandoning messages. Yet the processing is also occurring concurrently with the transactions that
 * are making those changes to the state of the schedule. As a result, the API has been carefully
 * defined to avoid treating each piece of schedule data as a uniquely addressable unit of
 * transactional data (i.e. one that could be directly manipulated as a singular item), even though
 * in reality that is how it is internally organized (using a unique identity called a "pid"). This
 * allows one transaction to be "unscheduling" a message, while the Scheduler is busy processing
 * that same message, without causing a conflict (because the behaviors are allowed to _compose_).
 *
 * To some extent, the Scheduler is a "third wheel" on a date: It's tacked on, but not particularly
 * relevant. For example, it does not have any persistent state of its own; instead, it relies on
 * the various ProcessorStore instances to manage their own state, which it then is given as part
 * of starting up the database. When a transaction commits, the Scheduler is not "in the loop"; all
 * of the necessary information (such as "the following pid has been processed") is captured and
 * stored by the various ProcessorStore instances, and only relayed to the Scheduler after-the-fact.
 * And when the database is shutting down, the careful coordination is between the TxMqnager and the
 * ObjectStores, and the Scheduler is pretty much on the sidelines, with any of its in-flight
 * processing at the risk of being aborted and rolled back by the TxManager. In other words, the
 * Scheduler is well-connected (to information) inside the database, and its life cycle is managed
 * by the database, but other than those aspects, it has no more "rights" than an application would.
 *
 * TODO on startup & recovery, all DBProcessors need to be started (so they dump their pending items
 *      onto the Scheduler)
 *
 * TODO need a way to track stats by dbo id
 *      class DboStats
 *          {
 *          Int inFlight;
 *          Int completed;
 *          retries
 *          failure by types (by commit result or exception -- and maybe which exception(s)?)
 *          Int totalFailed;
 *          Int exceptionCount;
 *          }
 *
 * TODO currently, the message processing is sequential, and not done in parallel across multiple
 *      clients, which is a temporary implementation (for simplification)
