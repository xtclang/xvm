# Eventually, after code reformatting and package renaming, we want an .editorconfig in the root.
# Right now, to phase that in, we allow an .editorconfig symlink in the root pointing out another
# not yet 100% project standard .editorconfig personal to the user, symlinked from here. Hence,
# right now, the root directory .editorconfig should be ignored by Git until after the new code
# conventions have been decided upon, and have enforcement tools in place as part of the build.
