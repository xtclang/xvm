TODO: REMOVE THIS FILE FROM SOURCE CONTROL BEFORE MERGE.

TODO:
* Fix the unicode rebuilder.
* Verify that platform builds and runs with the artifact, and clean it up.
* Verify that the output, error and input streams can be correctly redirected for all launchers.
        e.g. do we still get uninformative stuff like this from any failure:
        System.err.println("TODO: handle exec values and their output streams better than this: [manualTests] 'compileXtc' terminated abnormally (exitValue: -1). Rethrowing exception.");
* MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY ADD STREAMS AND NOT JUST OVERRIDE THEM, WE ALREADY HAVE THE WRAPPER FOR THE XTC LAUNCHER BUILDER. Great for testing, and screen scraping
  without having to do horrible things like taking over and redirecting a stream manually line by line.
* Check that no tests are disabled, and stuff like that, so that we maintain code coverage. I may have disabled something somewhere a long time ago.

Done:
* Verify that, or even better, write some kind of test that checks whether fork/not fork for the launchers works, is debuggable, and can handle exceptions without losing data, or performing unnecessarily complex logic.

Directly after merge:
* Start filing these TODOs as GitHub issues, elaborating on them a bit + enabling the creation of 10-20 small "simple" starter tasks for enhancements.
* Port examples.
* Background process launcher through the process builder.
* Disentangle tbe somewhat unintuitive runXtc* task collection. Need more clearly defined semantics and configurability. See the comment in the code about how I suspect
the run uses may be most easily understood and applied by and XTC developer.
* Create first release from master when merged, and add GitHub release plugin.
* Figure out how to automatically create a cool "what's changed" list when performing a release action, like, for example, this one: https://docs.GitHub.com/en/actions/learn-GitHub-actions/variables
* Publish to gradlePluginPortal and mavenCentral and get rid of the init.d workaround script that tries to hide all the credential juggling required to download Maven packages from a GitHub repo. This sucks, actually, but hoepfully
we don't remain on GitHub as our primary distribution channel for our artifacts for long after the release is done, tagged, and uploaded to gradlePluginPortal and mavenCentral. We stll probably want the GitHub Maven Repo, because
we can do snapshot releases and keep them there. All XDK devs should have little issue configuring this once, and once only.

Shortly after merge:
* Start implementing unit tests and simple integration tests for the plugin as quickly as humanly possible.
* Add the installation builder logic to a GitHub workflow.
* Add a GitHub workflow based on my xdk-release repository, which is a dockerized x86 Linux with nsis, that can cross-compile to all our supported platforms.
* Talk to Andres and figure out a way to do binary launchers from application plugin scripts or something similar. The launchers should be part of the self contained build and we should be able to cross compile on all platforms.
* Learn all the good stuff that JReleaser should be able to do for us (talk to Andres).
* Change plugin code to use e.g. BaseExec output stream classes or other existing functionality. There is way too many
animals in the "streams zoo" right now, when we try to process, log and rethrow build errors.

Maybe after merge:
* Implement an XTC logger, put it in extra.
* Use the PluginMaven default publication, don't add a special one for XTC. This is hardcoded and forced to generate docs and source from the gradlePluginPortal logic anyway.
* Allow configuration based running xtc module from gradlew - now just make the more fine grained results override the outermost ones. We do that in stdin/out but not the others.
* Command line retrieval programmatically/config option for XtcLauncher tasks. (dry run?)
* TODO: Cache launcher tasks?
* // TODO: Remember to use the ExecResult.stdoutContents variables instead of the horrible stuff we do with byte arrays.* Speed up build part 2
* Abort if running gradle and not gradlew. We just need a way to detect it.
* Investigate the Git release plugin
* Add a unit test to the test source set of something and just make sure the runXtcTest and compileXtcTest tasks
work. Source set specific configuration? We don't have that yet, I guess? Or do we? Check what we can derive
from the source set sent into the compile and run tasks for the test source set set.
* Make property prefix "org.xtclang." a global constant or something we instantiate the XdkVersionHandler with.
* Java doc gradlePluginPortal publication batter.
* UseLogging, prefix?
* Revisit all file/dir references in Gradle build scripts, or any providers in general, to ensure laziness and
  to avoid ugly hacks (especially to create paths). Like, there are several places that will look a lot prettier
  with the "provider {}" DSL sugar.
* Git Maven plugin to help ease the correct Git flow?

TODO:
* Unicode dependencies.
