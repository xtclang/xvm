/**
 * The base interface for all "database objects", which are the representations of entities declared
 * in the database schema, within the context of a database connection. DBObjects encapsulate the
 * notions of data organization, functionality (both generic and custom), and persistent storage.
 * The [categories](DBCategory) of database object are: [DBSchema], [DBCounter], [DBValue], [DBMap],
 * [DBList], [DBQueue], [DBProcessor], and [DBLog].
 *
 * The implementations of these various `DBObject` interfaces are provided by a specific database
 * engine implementation. A database schema developer may also provide their own additional
 * functionality in addition to the methods and properties on any of their own defined DBObjects in
 * their schema, by extending the appropriate DBObject interface, or by creating a `mixin` into that
 * interface. This is the same manner in which database schemas are designed; in the following
 * example, we see the concept applied both to the root database schema and to a DBObject within
 * that schema:
 *
 *     module Bank
 *             incorporates oodb.Database {         // <- this marks the module as a database module
 *         package oodb import oodb.xtclang.org;    // <- this is the OODB API
 *
 *         // this defines a custom database schema
 *         interface BankSchema
 *                 extends oodb.RootSchema {
 *             // this declares a database object within the schema
 *             @RO Accounts accounts;
 *         }
 *
 *         // this "customizes" the DBMap interface for holding Account objects
 *         interface Accounts
 *                 extends oodb.DBMap<Int, Account> {
 *             void transfer(Int fromId, Int toId, Dec amount) {
 *                 assert Account from := accounts.get(fromId), Account to := accounts.get(toId);
 *                 accounts.put(fromId, from.adjust(-amount));
 *                 accounts.put(toId, to.adjust(amount));
 *             }
 *         }
 *
 *         // this is just a value that can be stored in the database
 *         const Account(Int id, Dec balance) {
 *             Account adjust(Dec amount) {
 *                 return new Account(id, this.balance + amount);
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * That is an entire database schema, although obviously a very simple one. There are restrictions
 * defined for the names used within a schema, but primarily those restrictions are:
 *
 * 1. Do not use any of the names that would conflict with the names in the `oodb` interfaces. This
 *    one is simple; for example, if you are defining a schema, then you cannot use any of the names
 *    on DBSchema (including any names on its base interface, `DBObject`, i.e. this interface.)
 *
 * 2. Names may not end with an underscore. This rule is arbitrary, but it allows the database
 *    implementation of these interfaces to shield its implementations details (from collision),
 *    by suffixing any potentially colliding names with an underscore.
 *
 * It is expected that database engine implementations will make use of code generation to form a
 * deployable database type system built around the application's database module. Consider the
 * schema example above:
 *
 * * The `accounts` property of the schema needs to have an implementation automatically provided by
 *   the database engine that will produce a reference to a DBMap object that implements the
 *   `Accounts` interface;
 *
 * * The implementation of the `Accounts` interface needs to ensure that a call to `transfer()`
 *   is automatically wrapped in a transaction, if one does not already exist.
 *
 * While not required, a database engine is expected to provide a richer set of capabilities than
 * are defined in the `oodb` API; support for schema evolution is one obvious example. The use of
 * code generation allows these capabilities to be baked into an application's database without
 * dramatic performance penalties.
 *
 * The result of this `oodb` design is that an application's database design can remain completely
 * independent of a specific database engine. The custom logic and design within an application's
 * database schema couples to the underlying database engine implementation only through the `oodb`
 * API, yet are still able to support those customizations as if they were built into the database
 * engine itself.

     * requirement-test may be parameterized, so long as all of the arguments are immutable.

     * **not** against the current transaction), which means that the commit is predicated on other
     * concurrent transactions not having invalidated the test requirement. Additionally, the commit
